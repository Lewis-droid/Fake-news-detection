The contents of the file /fake-news-detector/fake-news-detector/data/true.kisiiuniversity.csv should be structured as a CSV file. Since you haven't provided the actual data, I will create a placeholder structure for the CSV file, assuming it contains columns for the news articles and their labels.

"label","text"
"true","This is a true news article about a recent event."
"true","Another true news story that provides accurate information."
"true","This article discusses facts and verified information."
"true","A true report on scientific discoveries and advancements."
"true","This news piece is based on reliable sources and evidence."
